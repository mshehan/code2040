<ul>
 <li>challenge1.py</li>
 <ul><li> for this particular challenge I simply made a POST to the API provided by code2040</li></ul>
 <li>challenge2.py</li>
 <ul><li>The purpose of this challenge was to print a random string returned by the code2040 API in reverse order and post it back</li>       </ul>
 <li>challenge3.py</li>
 <ul><li>the goal of this challenge was to find a needle in a haystack. where needle was a string and haystack was an array of strings</li></ul>
 <li>challenge4.py</li>
 <ul><li>this challenge required one to find all elements of an array that did not contained a substring returned from the API and return that list back</li></ul>
 <li>challenge5.py</li>
 <ul><li>this was the hardest challenge in my opinion. We were given a string containing a datetime in iso8601 format. Our goal was to add a time interval to this and return that string back in a POST in the same format.</li></ul>
